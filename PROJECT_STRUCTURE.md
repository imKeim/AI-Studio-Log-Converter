# Project Structure Overview

This document provides a clear overview of the files and directories in the AI Studio Log Converter project. It's designed to help developers and new contributors understand the purpose of each component at a glance.

---

## üìÇ Root Directory

-   **`ai-studio-log-converter.pyw`**: The main entry point of the application. This script parses command-line arguments and decides which mode to run (GUI, CLI, Batch, or Watch). The `.pyw` extension ensures that no console window appears when it's run in GUI mode on Windows.

-   **`build.bat`**: A batch script for Windows that automates the process of building the application into a single `.exe` file using PyInstaller. It first installs all necessary dependencies and then runs the build command.

-   **`clean.bat`**: A helper script to remove all generated files and directories, such as build artifacts (`dist`, `build`), log files, and configuration files. This is useful for starting with a clean slate.

-   **`requirements.txt`**: Lists all the Python packages required for the application to run (its runtime dependencies). These can be installed using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

-   **`requirements-dev.txt`**: Lists additional packages that are only needed for development, such as `pyinstaller` for building the application and `pytest` for running automated tests.

-   **`README.md`**: The main documentation file for the project. It contains a detailed description, features, usage instructions for both end-users and developers, and build steps.

-   **`PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md`**: This file! A map of the project's structure.

-   **`.gitignore`**: A standard Git file that specifies which files and directories should be ignored by version control (e.g., virtual environments, cache files, build outputs).

-   **`LICENSE`**: Contains the MIT License, which defines the legal terms under which the software can be used, modified, and distributed.

-   **`logo.ico` / `logo.png`**: Image assets used for the application's icon and in the GUI.

## üìÅ `src/` Directory

This directory contains all the core Python source code, organized into logical modules.

-   **`__init__.py`**: (Implicit) Makes the `src` directory a Python package, allowing for modular imports.

-   **`cli.py`**: Handles all Command-Line Interface (CLI) logic. This includes the interactive mode where the user is prompted for inputs and the "watch" mode that automatically processes files on change.

-   **`config.py`**: Manages all configuration-related tasks. It defines default settings, loads the `config.yaml` file, and creates it with helpful comments if it doesn't exist. It also handles loading language-specific templates.

-   **`converter.py`**: The heart of the application. This module contains the core logic for parsing the input JSON log files, extracting data, handling images, and converting everything into a well-structured Markdown file.

-   **`gui.py`**: Contains all the code for the Graphical User Interface (GUI), which is built using the `customtkinter` library. It defines the window layout, all the widgets (buttons, text boxes), and the functions that handle user interactions.

-   **`custom_theme.json`**: A JSON file that defines the custom color theme for the `customtkinter` GUI, ensuring a consistent and polished look.

---

## üìÅ `tests/` Directory

This directory contains all the automated tests for the project, which are run using `pytest`. These tests ensure that new features don't break existing functionality (regression testing) and that the core logic works as expected.

-   **`conftest.py`**: A special `pytest` file used to define "fixtures" ‚Äî reusable helper functions that set up data and environments for the tests.
-   **`test_converter.py`**: Contains all the test cases for the core logic found in `src/converter.py`.
-   **`data/`**: A subdirectory holding small, predictable data files (e.g., sample JSON logs) used as input for the tests.

## üìÅ `docs/` Directory

This directory contains all files related to the project's official documentation, which is built using Sphinx.

-   **`build.bat` / `clean.bat`**: Custom batch scripts for Windows to simplify building and cleaning the documentation. `build.bat` runs the Sphinx build process, and `clean.bat` removes the generated `_build` directory.
-   **`conf.py`**: The main Sphinx configuration file. It controls project metadata, extensions, themes, and other build settings.
-   **`index.rst`**: The master document and entry point for the documentation. It contains the main welcome message and the root `toctree` directive that structures the entire documentation.
-   **`api/`**: A subdirectory containing `.rst` files that define how the API documentation for each source module (`cli.py`, `config.py`, etc.) should be generated using `sphinx.ext.autodoc`.
-   **`_build/`**: This directory contains the final generated HTML documentation. It is automatically created by the `build.bat` script and should not be tracked by version control.
-   **`_static/` / `_templates/`**: Directories used by Sphinx for custom static assets (like CSS or images) and custom HTML templates, respectively.
